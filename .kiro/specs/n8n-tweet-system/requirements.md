# Requirements Document

## Introduction

n8n-tweet is an AI information collection and distribution system that automates the process of collecting AI-related content from RSS feeds and posting curated tweets to Twitter/X. The system provides a complete automation pipeline from content discovery to social media distribution, targeting researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: RSS Feed Processing

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL connect to configured RSS feeds (ArXiv, OpenAI Blog, Google AI Blog, etc.)
2. WHEN RSS feeds are processed THEN the system SHALL extract article metadata (title, description, URL, publication date)
3. WHEN new articles are discovered THEN the system SHALL store them for further processing
4. IF an RSS feed is unavailable THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other feeds

### Requirement 2: Content Filtering and Quality Assessment

**User Story:** As a content curator, I want the system to filter and score content for AI relevance, so that only high-quality, relevant content is shared.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN articles are processed THEN the system SHALL score them for AI relevance using keyword matching
2. WHEN content analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL assess quality based on predefined criteria
3. WHEN duplicate content is detected THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate processing
4. IF content score is below threshold THEN the system SHALL exclude it from tweet generation

### Requirement 3: Tweet Generation

**User Story:** As a social media manager, I want the system to automatically generate optimized tweets, so that content can be shared effectively within Twitter's constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN high-quality content is identified THEN the system SHALL generate 280-character optimized tweets
2. WHEN tweets are created THEN the system SHALL include relevant hashtags and URLs
3. WHEN tweet generation occurs THEN the system SHALL ensure proper formatting and readability
4. IF content exceeds character limits THEN the system SHALL intelligently truncate while preserving meaning

### Requirement 4: Twitter Integration

**User Story:** As an automation user, I want the system to post tweets automatically to Twitter/X, so that content distribution happens without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tweets are ready for posting THEN the system SHALL use Twitter API v2 for publishing
2. WHEN posting tweets THEN the system SHALL respect rate limiting constraints
3. WHEN duplicate tweets are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate posting
4. IF Twitter API errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### Requirement 5: Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and analytics, so that I can track system health and tweet performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL perform health checks on all components
2. WHEN tweets are posted THEN the system SHALL track metrics and maintain tweet history
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log structured error information
4. WHEN system status changes THEN it SHALL provide real-time monitoring capabilities

### Requirement 6: Deployment and Automation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy deployment and complete automation, so that the system can be set up and run with minimal manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment is initiated THEN the system SHALL support one-click setup with Docker Compose
2. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically configure all required services (n8n, PostgreSQL, Redis)
3. WHEN backup is needed THEN the system SHALL provide automated workflow backup/restore
4. IF system reset is required THEN it SHALL support complete environment reset functionality
